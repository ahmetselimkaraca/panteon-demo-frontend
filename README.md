# Frontend for Panteon Admin Panel

This is the frontend for my admin panel project.
Built using React + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
Used [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) UI library.

The build is included in the repo, as I faced issues with building on my t2.micro instance.
